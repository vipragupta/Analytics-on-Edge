edge on ec2
	1GB RAM
	40 fitbit clients 
	--> 10-12% CPU usage


Even if we use storm, it requires a powerful machines.
	For example when we were running our storm on a 1GB RAM machine, 
	and were running a a spout to read 377MB file.
	our CPU was going in more than 70% performance for 3 million lines.

	So same way you can run storm instances on edge.
